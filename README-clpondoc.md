## Christopher Pondoc (clpondoc)

Hey there! I'm Chris, and I'm a current senior/co-term at Stanford studying CS. A little bit about me:

- Spent time abroad at Oxford, where I worked on [deep reinforcement learning](https://github.com/cpondoc/ditto-nocturne) and collaborated with Joey Guman and Joey O'Brien (both of whom are also in 210!) to build an [RL environment for wildfire evacuation](https://github.com/sisl/wildfire)
- Worked on data connectivity and machine learning projects at Splunk
- Contributed to research in HCI ([exploratory and creative coding](https://spellburstllm.github.io/), human-LLM interaction) and computer vision ([realism of diffusion models](https://openreview.net/forum?id=wOC0BELg7g), [deep learning for histopathology](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3311790.3396663))
- Dove into the crypto rabbithole by designing [oracle](https://github.com/tellor-io/uniswapFallbackOracle) [systems](https://github.com/cpondoc/push-oracle) and [researching blockchain investments](https://www.tcv.com/)
- Built a startup that connected 100s of HS students to jobs and internships

Looking forward to meeting everyone!
